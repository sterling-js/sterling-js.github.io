        <h4>How to use the Demo Script View</h4>
        <p>The Sterling 1.1 demo comes preloaded with some example instances and scripts to demonstrate how custom visualizations are generated. The one to the right shows an instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem">dining philosophers problem</a>. To run a demo script, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <a href="/demo">demo</a>.</li>
            <li>Open an example instance by clicking the green Open button at the top right. It looks like this:</li>
            <li>Go to the Script View by clicking the Script button in the top navigation bar. The script view contains a script editor on the left and a rendering stage on the right, like you see in the image to the right.</li>
            <li>Execute the preloaded script by clicking the Execute button at the top of the script editor, it looks like this:</li>
            <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" class='img-fluid bordered-image mt-2 mb-2' src='/assets/posts/2021-03-01-demo-1-1/execute.png'>
            <li>Some instances, like the dining philosophers one, come from stateful models. After executing the script you can use the left and right arrow buttons located at the top-right of the rendering stage to explore how the state changes through time. These buttons look like this:</li>
            <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" class='img-fluid bordered-image mt-2 mb-2' src='/assets/posts/2021-03-01-demo-1-1/state.png'>
        </ol>
