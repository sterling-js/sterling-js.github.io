<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Sterling, like Alloy, is a self-contained executable which includes the Kodkod
   model finder, a variety of SAT solvers, the standard Alloy library, and a
   collection of tutorial examples. Additionally, the web interface is included
   so that a network connection is not needed to use Sterling. To execute, simply
   double-click on the jar file, or type <code>java -jar Sterling-1.0.0.jar</code>,
   replacing the version number to match the one you have downloaded.</p>

<h3>Current Release</h3>

<h4><a href='https://github.com/alloy-js/sterling/releases/tag/v1.1.0'>Sterling 1.1</a></h4>

<p>
    Sterling 1.1 is an incremental update that introduces the Script View. The Script View
    is used to generate custom visualizations from Alloy instances.

<h4><a href='https://github.com/alloy-js/sterling/releases/tag/v1.0.0'>Sterling 1.0</a></h4>

<p>
    Sterling 1.0 showcases a brand new user interface built using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/">Blueprint</a>. Aside from the overhauled interface, the most notable update is the lack of a tree view; its removal was an intentional decision, as it did not provide any functionality that isn't already present in the Alloy visualizer. Furthermore, the "snapshot" layout previously used in the graph view is no longer available. The graph rendering library has been entirely replaced and it does not yet support compound nodes (but will in an upcoming release).
