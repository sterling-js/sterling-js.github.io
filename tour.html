        <h2>A Brief Tour of Sterling</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Sterling! On this page, we give a brief introduction to the
            Sterling user interface. After taking this tour, you'll
            know how to navigate the views provided by Sterling and you'll be ready
            to explore some of the more in-depth features and settings on your own.

        <h3>Alloy</h3>
        <p>
            Sterling is a web-based visualizer for <a href='http://alloytools.org/'>Alloy</a>,
            providing enhanced graph and table views in an effort to make instances
            easier to explore and understand. It is built on top of Alloy 5.0.0.1, making only two
            small additions to the Alloy interface in order to support connection to the
            browser. When Alloy Sterling is first launched, you are given a link
            that will open Sterling in your default browser. Additionally, a
            "Web" button that does the same has been added to the Alloy
            visualizer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alloy is unchanged aside from these two additions, and
            using Sterling to visualize instances is entirely opt-in.

        <h3>Sterling</h3>

        <p>
            To Alloy users, Sterling will likely feel very familiar. The interface draws
            inspiration from Alloy, and many of its features have been migrated to Sterling.
            Much like the built-in Alloy visualizer, Sterling displays only a single
            instance at a time.

        <p>
            You are provided with three views &mdash; Graph, Table, and Source &mdash;
            that are accessible from the navigation bar at the top of the window.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Graph</strong> - A directed graph view of the instance</li>
            <li><strong>Table</strong> - A set of tables showing all sets and relations in the instance</li>
            <li><strong>Source</strong> - All source code files used to generate the instance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <strong>Next</strong> button at the right side of the navigation bar
            can be used to generate and display the next solution.

            The sidebar, on the left edge of the screen, contains buttons that
            will open a drawer which contains tools or options. The buttons above the
            divider are specific to the currently active view &mdash; Graph in
            the following image &mdash; and those below the divider are
            tools that are available regardless of the currently active view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take a look at what each view has to offer, starting with the
            Graph view.

        <h3>The Graph View</h3>
        <p>
            The graph view displays the current instance as a directed graph, and provides
            a lot of the same functionality as the Viz tab in Alloy. For example, projections
            are fully supported and relations can be viewed as attributes. Additionally,
            graph nodes are draggable and the view can be panned and zoomed. The following
            video gives a brief tour of some of the basic functionality in the Graph view
            (hover over the video to show controls &mdash; full screen is available).

        <h3>The Table View</h3>
        <p>
            The Table view displays the signatures, fields, and skolems of the current
            instance as a set of tables. Advanced sorting and filtering options make it
            easy to explore the instance and find the specific data you're looking for.
            Furthermore, Sterling introduces the ability to highlight skolemized
            variables, as shown in the video below.

        <h3>The Source View</h3>
        <p>
            The source view simply provides you with all of the Alloy source files used
            to generate the currently displayed instance. They are not editable files,
            and simply serve as a convenient way to refer back to the models.

        <h3>The Evaluator</h3>
        <p>
            The evaluator is a drawer tool that is accessible from any view by clicking
            on the terminal icon in the sidebar. It provides the same evaluator functionality
            that you are used to in Alloy and allows you to toggle between textual and
            tabular views of the results.
